## Summary

I'm 32. Now I'm a 4th year student of the specialty system administrator. Ever since school, I was interested in programming and design, but at first I focused on design. For a while I also tried to learn programming on server-side languages, but it was all wrong. In my third year at the university, I realized that the knowledge that was there was not enough, and enrolled in Software developer courses at NetCracker, which I finished in April 2020.

Then I realized that the front-end most successfully combines both of my hobbies. This was facilitated by the fact that in the courses I was entrusted to write the [front-ent part](https://quiz-front2020.herokuapp.com/home) in Angular. It was quite difficult, since our mentors were well versed in Java, but Angular was not very familiar to them, and I had to learn a lot on my own. However, I believe that I did well for the first time, and I want to continue my education in this direction.

  for(let i = 0; i < counter; i++){
    if (line.charAt(i) != line.charAt(line.length - (i + 1))){
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

console.log(isPalindrome("hattah")); //should print - true
